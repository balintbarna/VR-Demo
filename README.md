# VR-Demo

This is a free and open source demo project for exploring the possibilities in VR using Godot Engine. The project primarily focuses on the Oculus Quest 2 headset but other headsets may be supported.

The project uses CC0 resources, such as sounds and textures. These must be manually downloaded after cloning the project, at least until a better solution is found.
