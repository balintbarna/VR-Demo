# VR-Demo

This is a free and open source demo project for exploring the possibilities in VR using Godot Engine. The project primarily focuses on the Oculus Quest 2 headset but other headsets may be supported.

The project uses CC0 resources, such as sounds and textures. These are currently commited in Git, but this is maybe not ideal.

The plugin folder is ignored by git, therefore plugins need to me manually downloaded from the asset lib. For the plugins used refer to [the plugin list](addons_to_install.md).
